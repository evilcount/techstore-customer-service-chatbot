"""
tests/test_mandatory_cases.py — Mandatory Test Cases for the M2 Capstone (Stop 3).

These three test cases define the passing threshold for the Functionality score:
all three must pass for Functionality to exceed 50% (20/40 pts).

Tests are marked @pytest.mark.skip until TechStoreRAGAgent is implemented.
Remove the @pytest.mark.skip decorator from each test when you are ready to run it.

Running:
    # Run all mandatory cases (skipped until implemented)
    pytest tests/test_mandatory_cases.py -v

    # Run a specific test (after removing @skip)
    pytest tests/test_mandatory_cases.py::test_case_a_no_answer_guardrail -v

    # Run with detailed output including print statements
    pytest tests/test_mandatory_cases.py -v -s

Prerequisites before running:
    1. Complete Stop 3 implementation in src/
    2. Have data/ documents loaded and chroma_db/ built (or let the agent build it)
    3. Set OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
    4. pip install -r requirements.txt
